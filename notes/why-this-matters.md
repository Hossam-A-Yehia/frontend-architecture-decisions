# Why This Matters

## Faster onboarding
- Clear boundaries and public APIs help newcomers answer “where does this live?” fast.
- Result: useful PRs in days, not weeks.

## Safer changes
- Stable interfaces and local reasoning reduce unintended side effects.
- Result: fewer incidents labeled “small refactor went wrong.”

## Sustainable velocity
- Cohesive features allow parallel work without stepping on each other’s toes.
- Result: predictable delivery over time, fewer coordination costs.

## Quality at scale
- Explicit data access, caching, and state placement avoid subtle bugs.
- Result: fewer flaky tests and production regressions.

## Measurable outcomes
- Performance and observability provide feedback loops.
- Result: we optimize what users feel, not just what looks tidy in code.

## Talent retention
- Clean architecture and clear boundaries make day‑to‑day work less frustrating.
- Result: better morale and lower turnover.

## In short
> Good architecture keeps product speed high while reducing risk. It’s an investment that pays back every sprint.
